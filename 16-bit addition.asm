->The numberxis stored at locations 60H and 61H, with its most significant byte (MSB) in 60H andthe least significant byte in 61H.
->The numberyis stored at locations 62H (MSB) and 63H (LSB).
->Since the resultz = x + ycan be 17 bits long, store the result in memory locations 64H, 65H, 66H
->Forz=z16z15z14...z3z2z1z0, wherez0is the least significant bit andz16is the most significant bit,the memory location 64H should have 0000000z16,  the memory location 65H should have the bitsz15z14...z8, and the memory location 66H should have the bitsz7z6...z0.*/
