Software delay for 1 second:
Use the delay subroutine from question 2 in problem set 1 develop a 1 second timer delay.  
The programshould set the pins P1.4 to P1.7 of Port-1 for about 1 second and then clear these off.
Write the main routine which should:
     •Set the pins P1.4 to P1.7 of Port-1.
     •Enter a loop which calls the delay routine in each iteration
     •When the loop terminates, Clear the pins P1.4 to P1.7 of Port-1
Adjust the number of iterations in the main routine loop and the delay count to produce a total delay ofnearly 1 second
